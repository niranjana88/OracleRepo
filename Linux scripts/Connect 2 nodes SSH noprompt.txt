Connectin 2 nodes through ssh noprompt:
======================================

node1# ssh-keygen -t rsa	press "return" 3 times
node1# ssh-keygen -t dsa	press "return" 3 times

node2# ssh-keygen -t rsa	press "return" 3 times
node2# ssh-keygen -t dsa	press "return" 3 times


Now (from node1) add the generated keys to the ~/.ssh/authorized_keys file

node1# cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
node1# cat ~/.ssh/id_dsa.pub >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys

SSH from node 1 to 2

node1# ssh node2 cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
node1# ssh node2 cat ~/.ssh/id_dsa.pub >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys

Copy "authorizes_keys" from node1 to 2

node1# scp ~/.ssh/authorizes_keys node2 : ~/.ssh/authorizes_keys


Test:
Fire the below commands from both the nodes:-

ssh node1 date
ssh node2 date
ssh node1-priv date
ssh node2-priv date
ssh node1.test.nj date
ssh node2.test.nj date
ssh node1-priv.test.nj date
ssh node2-priv.test.nj date
