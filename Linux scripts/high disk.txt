The High Disk Utilisation indicate quite a few things lets discuss one by one.

 

1. Here i could suspect the DB time may be high and i think there would be presence of expensive sql statements, so just check in st04.

 

2. If you have Oracle Database then there is a chance of I/O bottleneck.

 

In the oracle session the I/O section is broken into subsections as

follow:

High Average Response Time per Read Request

High Average Response Time per Commit

High Average Response Time per Buffer Busy Wait

High Number of Waits for Free Buffers

High Number of Waits for Buffers being written to Disk

High Number of Space Waits for the Log Buffer

File System Response Times

 

So check the above mentioned part providers.

 

3. In the operating system monitor of the database server also we can  find

the  high numbers of I/O wait. This value indicates problems in I/O. So check on this.

 

4. And at last do monitor SM66 and if possible trace through st05 then we can

narrow down the problem why its going for Disk utilisation regularly. Try to find out the Report Name as well.

 

Finally analys the subsystem using external tools and still the problem is not getting solved the get in conatct with thehardware vendor of th I/O sub system.
